http://localhost:8983/solr/shoes/select?q=women side zip high heel leather ankle boots&q.op=or&fl=*,score&rows=100&group=true&group.field=original_id

# problem: men's item is the 3rd result. Check debug: eh, women is a common word. And this has lots of mentions for the frequent words (e.g. side, zip)

# switch to LM Jelinek-Merker

/opt/solr-8.2.0/bin/solr zk upconfig -n shoes -d conf/ -z localhost:9983; curl 'localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=RELOAD&name=shoes'

# now men's item is way lower (14). But our Diba and Reneeze are even lower :( Still, we have higher scores for more frequent terms, vs rare ones

# switch to 0.4, to make scores higher in general (so weight of e.g. "women" increases) then:

/opt/solr-8.2.0/bin/solr zk upconfig -n shoes -d conf/ -z localhost:9983; curl 'localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=RELOAD&name=shoes'

# rerun query: now Diba and Reneeze are 8 and 9, with Men 12. Seems like a good balance
