# rerun query. Better. Not perfect, though: warmup shorts. But if we look at jacket and sandals, we can see the difference in the weight of "shoes". Isn't penalized as it would be in the original paper (Lucene doesn't allow negative scores), but it's 0 in the jacket and some significant chunk in the sandals. Good

# if we switch to Chi-Squared, scores grow too much => shorts are too high :D
