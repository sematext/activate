# for tuning we need labeled data
head queries

# we can tune algorithms
cat params.txt
# samples at https://github.com/apache/opennlp/tree/master/opennlp-tools/lang/ml

# and how features get generated
cat features.xml
# all feature generators: https://github.com/apache/opennlp/tree/master/opennlp-tools/src/main/java/opennlp/tools/util/featuregen

# now let's trane a model
bin/opennlp TokenNameFinderTrainer -model urls.bin -lang ml -params params.txt -featuregen features.xml -data queries -encoding UTF8

# this should work
echo "solr elasticsearch youtube" | bin/opennlp TokenNameFinder urls.bin

# also works, we give it even more context
echo "solr elasticsearch on youtube" | bin/opennlp TokenNameFinder urls.bin

# no false positive here

# this one is too similar, though
